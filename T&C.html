              It is recommended that you thoroughly review the terms and
              conditions before deciding to sign up for our trip package.
              You enter into a contract with Epication and are presumed
              to have read and accepted all of the terms and conditions
              after you pay the deposit.

            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Verify personal and travel Information</h4>
            <p>
              Before paying the deposit, please verify the details of
              the package you have reserved. Such as the price of the
              package, the date and time of the return flight, the selected
              package includes lodging, including flight tickets or not and
              other pertinent information. If you don't report any errors
              or omissions in your package details within 24 hours of the
              confirmation letter receipt being issued, you will be assumed
              to have agreed with the information in the receipt or confirmation
              letter and fully liable for any risks and additional costs on the package.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Provision of details or Personal Information During Booking Destination
            </h4>
            <p>
              All of the information you give Epication while making a booking for a package is
              information that the business will use to fulfill the package you have selected.
              Before sending in a deposit payment, you must verify all information in this regard.
              All information given is deemed genuine and final if no adjustments are made.
              Epication assumes no liability for any inaccuracies or misinformation on this website.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Flight Ticket</h4>
            <p>
              Flight tickets from KLIA / KLIA 2 to the destination
              only are included in all Epication packages. Does
              not include domestic flight tickets to KLIA / KLIA 2.
              Any changes or modifications to the itineraries are possible.
              Epication disclaims all liability for any losses resulting
              from hotel reservations, domestic travel tickets, or other
              expenses paid by the participants themselves in the event
              that the flight schedule is altered. In addition, Epication
              disclaims all liability for any claims for damages resulting
              from modifications to the schedule, delays, cancellations,
              missing connections, technical issues, inclement weather,
              seat assignments during the flight, misplaced or delayed luggage,
              delayed check-ins, and/or rejections. getting on an airline flight.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Lodge and Accomodation</h4>
            <p>
              As it is understood, Epication introduces the idea of travel,
              and we typically select "local house," "apartment," or camping
              as our lodging, very seldom selecting a hotel. As a result, the
              room is set up to best suit the mode of transportation, particularly
              when using a rail or ferry. We will make an effort, nonetheless, to
              guarantee that each married couple and family has a room together.
              The married couple and the family will give notice in advance before
              departing once more if they decide to separate.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Intinerary</h4>
            <p>
              Each Epication trip is distinct, one-of-a-kind,
              and unlike any other. We reserve the right to alter
              our schedule at any time. Depending on the circumstances,
              the weather, and the state of affairs at the time,
              the captain reserves the right to alter the itinerary
              at any point during the journey without informing the passengers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Payment</h4>
            <p>
              Epication only takes cash, credit cards,
              and online banking as forms of payment.
              It is required of Epication to handle
              your online payment so that you may
              finish the transaction. If you are unable
              to finish the payment procedure because
              of delays in payment processing, Epication
              will not hold you accountable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Fees</h4>
            <p>
              Kindly ensure that the price agreed upon
              is shown on your receipt. The fees are
              subject to fluctuations in Malaysian Ringgit.
              There may be an additional cost to the
              original pricing if there is a currency
              increase of more than 10% from the initial
              rate or if there is an abrupt increase in
              operating costs because of unforeseen
              circumstances. Kindly consult our personnel.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In the case that the price of flights and
              operating ground movements changes unexpectedly,
              Epication holds the right to cancel,
              refund money, and apply additional fees.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Total Participitation</h4>
            <p>
              There are two types of Epication tours: small group
              tours, with 10 to 12 participants in each group, which
              comprise most of our trips; the exceptions are the
              Jerusalem, Umrah, and Winter Turkey tours. Similar
              to airline policies worldwide, which tolerate
              "overbooking" at a rate of 10 to 20% for small groups
              of 10 persons each, in order to mitigate the risk
              of last-minute cancellations or "no shows," The similar
              strategy is used by Rarecation, which accepts additional
              participation in groups of one or two. In the event
              that a participant cancels at the last minute,
              Rarecation can still proceed with the trip with a
              total of 10 persons (more or less) in one group.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Deposit</h4>
            <p>
              The participant must pay the full deposit
              amount right away in order to guarantee
              participation. Please check your package
              since the full amount of the deposit is
              equivalent to 40 to 50% of the package price.
              Sixty days prior to the departure date
              Payment in full is required.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Direct payments to EPICATION TRAVEL SDN BHD RHB account 1033 2345 9023 are accepted.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Cancellation</h4>
            <p>
              We regret to tell you that if a person cancels,
              there will be no refund of the money paid. If
              for any reason Epication needs to cancel
              (natural disasters, bombings, etc.), we will
              refund the deposit for any services not yet
              used (hotel, vehicle rental, etc.); however,
              there will be administrative fees of RM 350
              per person for the services rendered.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Change Trip</h4>
            <p>
              There will be administrative fees of RM 350
              per person for those who have already registered
              and wish to change the trip date or even to
              another excursion. This is a result of the job
              that our team has completed, and we also need
              to locate a successor to take over the open
              position. There's also a chance that Epication
              won't be able to locate a replacement in the allocatted time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px">Travel Insurrance</h4>
            <p>
              All of our trip comes with travel insurance
              already, with the exception of those that involve
              flights outside of Malaysia.
